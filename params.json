{"name":"DesignKit","tagline":"Innovative iOS framework helping developers create beautifully designed applications","body":"<p align=\"center\" >\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Legoless/DesignKit/master/Assets/designkit-logo.png\" alt=\"DesignKit\" title=\"DesignKit\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe mission of this innovative iOS framework is to enhance and speed up the creation of beautiful iOS applications, while keeping the learning curve as easy as possible. This is done by following the next milestones:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#### Styling code is completely decoupled from controller objects\r\n<br />\r\nThis is achieved by abstracting visual style of UI elements into special style classes, which are not connected to view controllers. The NUI framework handles the case of style files.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#### Integrates with multiple well-known design oriented frameworks\r\n<br />\r\nPopular frameworks such as Masonry, SVGKit and POP are integrated out of the box, to keep the design as consistent and smooth as possible.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#### Attempts to bridge the gap between design tools and iOS SDK\r\n<br />\r\nDesignKit provides plugins and extensions for popular designing tools such as Sketch 3 and Adobe Photoshop CC. Plugins will generate native DesignKit code to be used in existing projects.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n### Adds design sources can used in multiple projects\r\n<br />\r\nThere are multiple resources available in DesignKit that help iOS developers create common interface elements faster. Those include most common used colors, such as Facebook color, common usage and social icons.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#### Reduces application's memory fingerprint by utilizing vector graphics\r\n<br />\r\nVector graphics require very small memory fingerprint, while keeping animations and interaction fast and fluid.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n# The Ideas\r\n<br />\r\nIdeas for this project come out of multiple frameworks in many different technologies. Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n**Styling** is decoupled from business logic on many platforms for example in World Wide Web and Windows Presentation Foundation, including Windows Phone.\r\n\r\n**Vector graphics** is used on map platforms, because it is small to transfer over network connection. It is also very easy to modify. Simply change the color in code (yes, I know about tintColor property).\r\n\r\n**Resources** are shared throughout multiple projects, for example: Share to Facebook usually contains Facebook icon with Facebook trademark color. Why should we always search for it, through other projects\r\n\r\n**Layout** is sometimes a pain. Even with second iteration of auto-layout there is still a lot of layouts that are a pain to create. Inspired by Windows Presentation Foundation we use special layout managers that make this easy.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCompatibility\r\n========\r\n<br />\r\nThe framework requires iOS 7. Mac OS X is currently not supported.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTesting\r\n========\r\n<br />\r\nJust download the zip and open the sample project or try:\r\n\r\n`pod try DesignKit`\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContributions\r\n======\r\n<br />\r\nA big thanks goes to all contributors of the following projects, which were a great help in creating the **DesignKit**.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/tombenner/nui\r\n- https://github.com/SVGKit/SVGKit\r\n- https://github.com/cloudkite/Masonry\r\n- https://github.com/bengotow/PSDWriter\r\n- https://github.com/layervault/psd.rb\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nContact\r\n======\r\n<br />\r\nDal Rupnik\r\n\r\n- [legoless](https://github.com/legoless) on **GitHub**\r\n- [@thelegoless](https://twitter.com/thelegoless) on **Twitter**\r\n- [legoless@arvystate.net](mailto:legoless@arvystate.net)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLicense\r\n======\r\n<br />\r\nDesignKit is available under the MIT license.
